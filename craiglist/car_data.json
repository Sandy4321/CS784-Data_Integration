It drives nice, stops confidently and is a joy to take on day trips around Wisconsin.\nWe've recently installed a new exhaust, tires and battery. The timing belt and water pump were replaced only five thousand miles ago. That is nice to have done and out of the way because it can be pretty expensive to replace. There are no know problems other than the ABS lamp is illuminated (the way it was when we bought it) and; the Supplemental restraint system (airbag) lamp is also lit. This is a more recent occurrence which we chose not to correct. Brakes should be relatively fresh however; I couldn't be certain how many miles ago since I do the brake jobs on all my vehicles. They all kind of melt together in my mind. The interior is in very nice shape and looks amazingly fresh. The paint is fair but will still take a shine even if you use a little Mr. Wizard's Mist & Shine. There is the typical rust by the wheel wells that this model always seems to have.\nMost records are still available for this vehicle. I should also have a shop manual the buyer is welcome to have.\nFuel economy link: http://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/noframes/12109.shtml\nFeatures:\n2.2L 4 Cylinder, 4 speed automatic.\nBlue with gray interior.\nAdjustable steering wheel.\nCruise control.\nPower sun roof.\nPower lock and windows.\nPower driver seat.\nRear window defrost.\n6 Passenger seating.\nRemovable mid row seats.\nFold down 3rd row seat.\nPower steering.\nPower brakes.\nAir conditioning.\nNew battery.\n2 New front tires a couple of years old.\nOnly 5 thousand miles on a new timing belt and water pump.\nOne year on new exhaust.\nIf you are interested in scheduling a time to view the van I can be reached Monday through Friday between the hours of 7AM to 10PM.

Has 4 new tires with less than 6,000 miles along with new brakes and front rotors. All lights work with the exception of the left dashboard turn signal indicator, which is intermittent (the outside blinker lights however, always work) and rear passenger side window goes down electrically but needs help to roll up if you roll it down too far and will need a new window regulator.

The motor and transmission in this vehicle are not original and currently only have 120,000 on them. My grandfather and father swapped out the engine/trans and the lower mileage set in about 3 years ago, the body has 216,000 miles on it. Minimel rust, straight body with no dents. Really clean body for the year, the full mock convertable top is in good condition. It starts up everytime, runs, drives and stops excellent. Tires and brakes are good all around. The interior is fair, there's some cracking/rip in the front seats and on the drivers door panel. Has a droopy headliner but its all intact. All windows, lights and electronic components all work. Needs some work but none of it is major or anything that would prevent it from being driven everyday. I wouldnt hesitate to drive it anywhere, its a very reliable and strong running classic Cadillac. If it was perfect or mint it wouldnt only be $1200 so please dont show up expecting a $5000 car for this cheap.

The car has a nice leather interior, six-disc changer, an auxiliary input, heated seats, and more. The car has had regular oil changes and maintenance at manufacturer-recommended intervals. The car is an absolute joy to drive during all seasons. It is very fast and has great handling. Being a Subaru with all wheel drive, it is also great in the snow. I am including a set of winter tires with the car (it currently has summer tires on). When the snow tires are on this is probably the safest, most fun car you could have in the winter time.\nThe car is in excellent mechanical condition. There is a small dent on the right side of the car, behind the back door. An old roommate hit the car at very low speed while it was parked. The dent is only visible in some light.\nI bought this car certified pre-owned and in excellent condition from a Subaru dealership  in 2011. I have put 23,000 miles on the car in the three years I have owned it. I have all maintenance records for the time I have owned the car.",

I paid 4,200 about two years ago and it's been a champ as my daily driver. It is the first car I ever owned and I'm ready for something bigger. I want something with 4wd, preferably a small truck. 4 or 6 cylinder. I am willing to pay money on top if your truck is worth it of course. The honda does need a little work. There is a small hole in the exhaust and causes it to sound loud when accelerating. It's a cheap fix I just haven't had the time. The top of the car also has some scratches. It was that way when I bought it. As far as rust goes, it is very minimal for how old the car is. Only a small spot around the rear panel. It would be a perfect first car for someone else. The car has another 150,000 miles in it easy so let's make it yours.  \nText/email me if interested.",

    "body": "Thinking about switching up cars as I've had a couple mr2s now.  This car was originally SMG but the hood and bumper were replaced by previous owner and didn't match the color so it has black plastidip on it now.  It is the rarer sunroof model and an original turbo model.  This is also originally an Arizona car so no rust and hasn't seen a Midwest winter yet.\nModifications:\n3rd gen 3sgte swap with a 5 speed LSD transmission\n2.5 inch custom exhaust\n3 inch intake\nEMSPowered Intercooler/piping\nHKS bov\nadjustable struts with intrax springs\nRear strut bar\nFront and rear TRD sway bars\n93+ turbo OEM brakes (bigger than the previous years)\nStage 4.5 clutch kit from TCS Motorsports, installed when I had the swap done about 5000 miles ago. good for 450rwhp\nPioneer speakers and tweeters in both doors. Looks like a nice, professional job.\nProbably more that I'm forgetting\nRunning on 17 inch wheels with brand new Federal 595 EVOs (215/40/r17) up front and falken azenis 615s (235/40/r17) out back.  Fresh oil change on 10/6 with mobil 1 full synthetic 5w-30.\nThe bad:\n-Turbo exhaust seal causes it to burn oil after it warms up at idle until you start driving it.  Clearly not a lot as I haven't had to add oil in between oil changes, but I do have a spare turbo laying around.\n-The DVD player isnt properly mounted.  Couldn't get my dash kit to work so it is sitting in the dash, just gets in the way of the HVAC controls\n-Does not have air conditioning or power steering.\n-Plastidip\n-Has gauge pod but no gauges installed yet.\n-Clutch pedal squeaks, easy fix on twosrus.com",

Mechanically it runs good but the CEL light is on because of an A/C Evaporater code and the ABS light is on due to an ABS sensor. Last fall I had the radiator, thermostat, and hoses replaced. Also had most of the front end components replaced around the same time.

I made the necessary repairs and added new wheels and tires. The old ones are included for winter driving. I also have the rear seat that goes with it. There is no radio and the heater is not working. This is a really fun vehicle and it drives and runs good. If you would like to have a vintage Jeep, this one is well worth a look., in fact I can't believe it hasn't sold! Perhaps my price is too low and people think there's something wrong with it. At any rate, I'm cleaning up leftover inventory and need to get it sold. My back up number is 563- six zero 8- 0393. Sorry, I can't process texts. Thanks for looking.",

We used it for trips back and forth to Minneapolis, MN and usually averaged 28-30mpg. Great highway car. Ready to go another 100k miles, if not more.\nLoaded with just about every available factory option for 2006:\n3.0 6 cylinder engine, sport automatic transmission\nxDrive All Wheel Drive System\nCold Weather Package with dual adjustable heated seats, heated steering wheel, heated windshield washer fluid, headlight washing system, rear defroster, dual zone climate control, and parking heater\nDVD Navigation System with voice command and bluetooth phone integration\nBlack Sapphire Metallic Pearl paint, Dakota Black full leather interior option\nAdaptive Xenon headlights which turn with the steering wheel\nSport Package with 20 way adjustable sport seats (a wonderful upgrade)\nPower everything, adaptive cruise control, dual zone climate control, etc.\nPark Assist Package with front and rear park distance control sensors and audible distance meter\niDrive vehicle command system\nLogic 7 sound system with CD changer dual facotry subwoofers (best sound system I've ever had in a car, great upgrade over base stereo)\nplenty more I am sure I am missing, but you get the idea, its loaded.\nIn addition I have added a set of 18\" BMW M-sport wheels and brand new Goodyear all-season tires this spring at roughly 100k miles. I am fanatical about preventative maintenance and the car has always seen full synthetic oil changes ahead of schedule. I also replaced both the front and rear brakes within the last 12 months. AGM Interstate battery is less than a year old. Updated New cabin air filters every 6 months. Alignment and all fluids flushed within the past 12 months. the list goes on.\nIn addition, I also have some extras that can be negotiated into the sale. I have two sets of floor mats, cloth for summer and rubber all-season mats for winter, both of which were new last year (Genuine BMW). I have also mounted a new set of Bridgestone Blizzak WS-70 tires to the factory 17\" wheels last fall. This is the best car I have ever owned in the snow.\n$14950 gets the car with your choice of wheels. Get both sets for a little bit extra. I am only selling because we purchased a new 535i xDrive to replace this car. Clear title in my name. This is a wonderful car and will make the new owner very happy! Calls only please, \n \n\nM5 M3 M4 M6 M2 Msport M-sport 335i 335xi 330xi 330i 528xi 528i 535xi 535i 550i 550xi CPO e60 e61 f10 f11 f12 540i 545i x3 x5 x6",

(there's no paper work to prove that, but I will let the truck speak for itself on how well it shifts.) \nBesides that there are a few dents that are shown in the pictures and the windshield has a largely unnoticeable crack across the bottom, the best way I can explain it is that it rides across behind the windshield wipers and does not obstruct vision.\nAll electric windows, working lights. It is a 700$ mini van with 3 rows of seating and oem radio with infinity premium speakers. comes with 2 seats of keys and ready to go. hatch closes squarely some Wisconsin rust, but the under-body looks like NEW with solid exhaust and Cadillac converters\nIf you have any questions or are interested in scheduling a time to come check it out feel free to contact me by email. \nThanks, \n            Will \nalso have\n84 ford e350 box truck for 1k\n82 honda mb-5 for 600\n76 honda cl125 for 250\n89 yamaha razz super scoot 400\n18ft trailer 150\n21ft trailer both need deck 175\nTags\nWill trade/barter for plasma cutter manual Subaru  honda toyota ford dodge diesel 4x4 awd stick hatch back wagon cash iso acura lexus wanted nissan volvo vw or standard transmission no sedans no chevy chervolet or gmc",

Car painted with a Burnt Copper Flake - House of Colors Paint, looks  black until you get sunlight on it and it really shines.  Brougham top re-dyed black.  Taillights and headlights were tinted (some coming off one headlight), new fender trim pieces and some other new chrome trim pieces. Over $7k worth of work done @ Rose Custom & Collision in Madison.\nFull Custom JL Audio Stereo System with high end Alarm installed in 2011 @ AMS in Madison.  Over $5k invested.  4 12\" subs, sub amp, Fully custom trunk install, Components mounted in front doors, Kenwood Flip out Nav unit installed.

The compression tests 235lbs across all 4 cylinders.  Trans is solid, clutch is great as well.  \nThis car is fast and a front runner where ever it is raced.  I have raced Dells Raceway Park (just took the season championship, in Outlaw Bandits this season), Jefferson, Slinger, Rockford, and Winchester Speedway in Indiana.\nI am willing to sell the car only (with one set of extra tires and race wheels), for $2500.  For $3000, you can get the car, and all the wheels, tires, transponder, parts, etc.  I have too many parts to mention.  For $4000, you get everything including the hauler....(not the truck, just the trailer)  I just put a new bed on the trailer last season, and a new axle this year.  Has single axle electric brakes and an electric winch.  Trailer is just under 22' total.  I hauled my full size hobby stock on it with no problem.  \nMy prices are firm as this car is well worth the money.  I'm selling because I'm looking to team drive next season in a hobby or sportsman.  Not selling because I have to.  If you have seen this car race, you know it's fast and reliable, and very well built.  Has 2014 belts and butler seat and 6 point cage.\nHere is a link to other pix of the car.  These were taken last October, but car is still the same.  Most of the visible lead is currently not in the car.\nhttps://www.facebook.com/ed.klug.9/media_set?set=a.10153450114390602.1073741837.507735601&type=3",

Everything works great and it is as close to new as you could get it!\nThe engine is very strong as well as the transmission with no problems!! I do have a few mercedes and my daily runner already has over 380k on it as well as my daughters with just over 300k and they run like new, so there is something to say about Mercedes!!!\nThe interior of this car is in like new condition, not even a spot on the carpets. The investment in this car is way over the asking price as you can tell when doing some research and you will have a hard time finding one like it!! My Family and friends think that I am nuts to sell this car but I do have many more projects and do therefore need to sell some.\nThe only thing that is wrong is that I was never able to open the glove box, the cable must be off and I never took the time to have it fixed since I never had to use it, so if you find treasures in there I guess they will be yours to keep! \nIt does not miss a beat with lots of power and will hug the road!!!\nI only drove the car very few times after it was done and it is kept  like a baby, under cover in my Garage! Please feel free to have the car inspected by any one you like!\nThings that where done:\n- Wald body Kit (bumper front and rear plus side skirts )\n- Upgraded front head lights with LED surround along with clear corner lights\n- Custom Fog lights\n- Upgraded front Grille \n- Upgraded Wood Shift Knob with Chrome suround \n- Upgraded exhaust/ tailpipes \n- Upgraded Brakes\n- Upgraded new suspension  including new shocks, lowering springs , damper, wheel spacing. . .\n- Upgraded new tail lighting\n- New 18' Chrome Wheels\n- Complete tune up including trans. fluid/ filter, oil Synthetic! new plugs , wires . . ..\n- Upgraded side mirrors\n- Mud flaps/ Guards\n- brand new AC compressor \n- Mercedes Rubber Floor mats \nStandard equipped with\n- Heated seats\n- CD Changer in the trunk\n- Backup guides\n- Double thermo tinted Windows ( or as they call it bullet proof Glass)\n- Radio/CD/Weather Chanel/ Tape\nI also have 4 original Rims that will also go with the car in case you want to mount snow tires. . .\n$12990,00 OBO\nPlease call me with any questions you might have at",

    "body": "Impeccably maintained, one owner, 2008 Toyota Camry Hybrid for sale. This car is in terrific condition with 65,275 miles. It has been serviced at the dealership for all services. Recommended services were conducted on time and I have all receipts available for you to inspect. There were no pets, smoking, or even food allowed in the car. \n It was involved in a minor accident while waiting for traffic in an intersection a few years ago. As a result, the front bumper and grill had to be replaced - total cost for repair was $1815.00 for labor and Toyota bumper (not aftermarket) which shows just how minor the damage was. I have the repair invoice to show you exactly what had to be repaired. However, because of this minor accident, we are pricing it less than we would had it not been in an accident. The only reason it is even being sold is because an AWD vehicle was needed for winter driving. \n We still have the original window sticker for the car which lists out at $31,110. It comes with many bells and whistles which include heated power front leather seats, heated side mirrors, power tilt/Slide moon roof, 16\" alloy wheels, voice activated DVD Navigation with JBL, and 4 Disc in dash CD changer w/Bluetooth and 8 speakers in 6 locations. It also includes leather wrapped steering wheel and shift knob and auto-dimming rear view mirror with compass. And the best part is it gets about 35 mpg!",

I also replaced the water pump, thermostat, spark plugs, spark plug wires, rear exhaust manifold heat shields and breather tube with AC Delco parts.  Other engine related parts replaced at that time were the belt and belt tensioner.\nWithin the last month I replaced the left front wheel bearing and both front stabilizer links, rear liftgate switch pad and installed a set of new Voxx  wheels.\nWithin the last year it has had new tires and the drive shaft replaced. The drive shaft was purchased new from a GM dealer for $900.\n The body is straight with no dents. It does have some chips and scratches but, nothing out of the ordinary for a vehicle with 143,000 miles. The interior does have some stains on the divers seat but no smoke or pet odors.\nEverything is in good working order. No engine, transmission, or coolant leaks. The AC blows cold and the brakes are good.\nText or call Dennis at 6zero8 2nine3 0five29. Please leave a message and I will get back with you as soon as possible. Don't ask me how much I will take for it before you come and look at it. I'm not desperate to sell so keep the low ball offers.  And I don't need help selling it.",

This is a used car so there will be some minor fixing to do to make it a excellent car that will last another 150,000 miles. Car has new O2 sensor and ignition coils. Car comes with brand new tires which cost 600.00. \nBad: Car has a check engine light but runs fine and the power steering seems to be leaking somewhere. The steering wheel gets hard and soft randomly but should be an easy fix. \nAgain, it's a used car and still starts up every time with no problem. Asking price is 2000.00 OBO. Pictures can be sent if request and open for test drive if requested. Great car that comes with BRAND new tires, ignition coils and all O2 sensors has been switch. Oil has been changed as well!",

Per a mechanic's review, it may only need replacement parts but would not rule out a new engine based upon further examination and dissembly of same.

There are a couple problems. The exhaust is a little loud. Also the ABS light is on. The front drivers side connector for the sensor came undone. You'd just have to buy the replacement connector and connect the wires. Its about $22 from O'Rielys. The light doesn't bother me that much so I never replaced it. \nThe car has tint all around. Not sure what % it is, it was put on by the previous owner. The tint is starting to peel away. This is a really reliabale car. I've taken it to Fargo and back twice without problem. Its has great heat, however there is no A/C. \nThere has been a lot done to this car in the last year, so the price is pretty firm. The miles will ho up its my daily.

This car is originally from Texas and was brought up to the midwest, where I in turn acquired the car. \nSpecs: 2.7L inline 6 with the 4 speed automatic, 146k miles. Clean and Clear title\nA LOT of recent mechanical work done by my local shop who does a lot of Imports. The car has had a full suspension overhaul including lowering the car an inch on H&R sport cup springs and Bilstein shocks and struts, New Brakes all the way around including the soft brake line hoses that go to the calipers and a full brake fluid flush. The Engine was overhauled with New timing belt kit which included the tensioner, water pump, thermostat, a few of the hoses and fresh coolant, while they had all the timing stuff apart they did all the timing cover seals, plugs and wires, valve cover gasket and a complete valve adjustment, the engine runs great, strong and has tons of power. Also on the list was the oil pan gasket, rear differential seal with new gear fluid and the transmission pan gasket along with a full transmission fluid drain and fill. The car doesn't leak a drop.\nExterior:\nBody of the car is in nice shape, but the black is not the original color, it was a silverish green, so personally im glad they did paint it, its in good shape, just the door jams were left undone, but this isn't a huge deal since when your in or out of the car the doors are usually closed...my guess is the original paint had a lot of sun fade from the harsh Texas sun so this was there solution. It cleans up well and looks good. Upgraded Euro Elipsode projector Headlights with 4300k Xenon HID kit. Always get thumbs up from people and many many compliments. Especially with the 17\" ASA BBS style wheels on it. Recently also had the Windows tinted 20% so that it didn't look like a fish bowl. The front windshield was also replaced due to a large chip that started cracking along with new front and rear windshield trims installed professionally\nInterior:\nThe interior of the car is in very nice shape, mostly black with just the brown sport seats for that nice two tone affect. New BMW floor mats and a few other trim pieces here and there, otherwise all the electrics work as they should, Moon roof, all power windows, locks and mirrors works flawlessly along with the climate control, and original radio. The leather is in very good shape for its age, Dash does have the usual e30 dash cracks, \nOverall the car is in very good shape, This ad is just the tip of the iceberg for the history of the car so if you have more questions or would like to take a serious look at the car. please dont hesitate to call or text but i ask only Serious inquires with cash. Not in a hurry to sell so no low ball offers. Thanks and have a great day.",

    "body": "I bought the car with a cracked windshield, a few dings on the face of the trunk, and a loud exhaust(flexpipe) for $2000 with very little rust. The car was at 216000 miles it is now at 219000 miles but a friend of mine hit me while passing me as he was trying to show off. It needs a bumper, passenger side front panel and head light. there is also a minor scuff just above the headlight on the hood the door was untouched and the hood still lines up perfectly. This car is an automatic, it still shifts flawlessly with the auto-stick.  I know the woman that owned the car since 30,000 miles and it was never beat on, always adult driven, has had synthetic oil EVERY oil change, and always had routine maintenance. the car was never in an accident prior to mine. It has all its power, shifts smooth, and no funny noises. its silver with black cloth interior with black tint. the only thing wrong with it is the ac needs to be charged. This is not a car for a 16 year old It is too fast as it tops out over 150 mph still.  \nI have a kid on the way or I would fix it myself, i'm taking over my fiance's truck and she got a new car, this one is not big enough. I know it is a steal as these motors when maintained as this one has make it up over 300,000, you can't feel a flaw in the transmission, and the body is damn good as it was garage kept until 2 years ago.  Long story short, don't message me with a $1000, i don't have time to waste but i can afford to wait for the right buyer. That being said, If you buy it before 4 pm tomorrow i will take 1200 because i will be in and out of town the rest of the week and my phone is broken but if you message me your number I can call you. Car runs and drives great as is and is extremely fast for stock. just needs some love. I will give you my number through email. I can text you pics of the damage but i'm telling you now it only needs a bumper, quarter panel and head light. fast as hell. sunroof, cloth int.",

The navy blue metallic paint turns a lot of heads. The 3.8L v6 is quick and excellent on gas mileage (consistently 25-30 mpg). Car sounds great with the Magnaflow exhaust. It's stored inside under a cover during the winter months. The t-tops make it the perfect summer car.\nI'm only selling because I bought a beater for the winter months, and I barely drive the Firebird anymore due to school and work (less than 1,000 miles in the last year). It's time for someone else to have their fun with this car.\nEmail/text works best due to my busy schedule. Thanks for looking!",

So, it has a new clutch in the last couple years, new shocks last year all the way around.  Comes with two sets of wheels and tires.  One an all season set, one a winter set.  Both have about 50% tread.  Great truck. can't say enough about it.

The interior is fair, there's some cracking/rip in the front seats and on the drivers door panel. Has a droopy headliner but its all intact. All windows, lights and electronic components all work. Needs some work but none of it is major or anything that would prevent it from being driven everyday. I wouldnt hesitate to drive it anywhere, its a very reliable and strong running classic Cadillac.

It has always been adult driven and the previous owner had it regularly serviced at the CA dealer. I purchased the car for my wife and it's never even been out in the rain and stored during the winter. I would feel confident driving this car across country there are no known mechanical issues, it does need a new spring for the drivers seat belt if you want that to fit tight. The car is in excellent shape it has the original factory mags and good tires. It was repainted once I believe and there are just a couple bubbles above the windshield trim and on the hood (you can see in the pictures) this car is all original metal, the floor is rock solid as well as all the metal around the wheels (see pictures) The air conditioner needs a charge but we never bothered because it's made to be driven with the windows down and the T-Tops off. This is the talking Z so it will tell you if the lights are left on or if your door is open etc. Current mileage 149K, I had the top end of the engine rebuilt a couple years ago, Cam Valves Timing Chain etc.  Make Offer!!\nSimilar to Mazda.\nTRADE CONSIDERED, YOUR ITEM DOESN'T NEED TO BE WORKING, LET ME KNOW WHAT YOU HAVE.

I have run it on Biodiesel and it can be converted to run on vegetable oil. The engine runs great and haven't had any problems on that end other then the usual maintenance. We have done a lot of work underneath - struts, shocks, bearings, breaks, rear axle, etc. Breaks will soon need to be replaced, but other then that, she is pretty solid.\nKnown issues is the vacuum system. It developed a leak the 3rd year we owned it and we had it capped off to keep it from getting worse. So the locking system is now manual. And since Wisconsin salts it's roads, rust has become more apparent in the few years we have been here.\nIf you are interested, let me know and I can forward you maintenance receipts, as well as more detailed photos of the vehicle.

I will miss this car though. I bought it with 60K on it and have 139,900 now with LOTS of life left. . . especially with all the new parts. Here's a rundown of what has been replaced around 127,000, since then it runs awesome!\n- all fluids changed, oem antifreeze and full synthetic oil changes the life of the car.\n- windshield washer pump and reservoir\n- Front control arm kit (Both Left and Right sides)\n- Rear shock kit\n- new charcoal cabin filter\n- Hydraulic tensioner pulley\n- Idler pulley\n- All 6 ignition coils\n- Changed differential fluids\n- Mass air meter boot kit\n- New valve cover gasket kit and valve cover\n- CCV valve and all hose kit (cold climate version)\n- All belts replaced\n- fan clutch\n- thermostat\n- both cv axles\n- New tires all around and 4 wheel alignment\n- Just replaced pads and rotors with drilled and vented. . . WOW, brakes work.\nYou get the benefit of all these repairs without the $5,000 dealer repair bill. . . my loss, your gain. Nice thing is, these aren't due again for another 125K miles and theses cars will go half a million miles as long as it's maintained.\nEverything that needed to be done at the 125K mark + more. Since the maintenance I have seen a dramatic increase in mpg and performance. It's a great daily driver and a road trip machine. I get 24-26 mpg in the city (unless I get on it a bit then about 21-22 mpg) and 32-36 mpg on the Hwy.\nOther features. . .\n- leather (in great shape still) non smoking, no pets.\n- cold weather package: heated seats, mirrors, switchable traction control\n- headlight washers\n- integrated bluetooth phone system\n- A/C\n- Power windows\n- moonroof\n- telescoping steering wheel\n- cruise\n- roof rack\n- traction control\n- stability control\n- hill descent control\n- ABS 4-wheel\nIf I were looking for a great handling, safe wagon with plenty of space, speed and performance. . . this is the car. \nNo dealers please. Also, I have used KBB, NADA, Local BMW dealership, Carsoup, Edmunds and Autotrader to determine my price. Adding in all the cost of all the new parts, this is a steal. If you are a legitimate potential buyer, by all means, call with additional questions and/or offers.",

    "body": "$2990 or Best Offer\nThis is a very good car and drives nicely.  I have owned it since 2005; I purchased it with approximately 24,000 miles from a dealership.  It has received regular maintenance the entire time I have owned it and has been used mainly for highway driving - about 90% of the time. I was getting around 32 mpg. I have never had problems with the engine or transmission.\nImprovements recently done:\n*4 brand new Goodyear 50,000 mile tires put on in Dec 2013 (little mileage since)\n*Both FRONT & REAR brake pads and rotors replaced about 6 weeks ago\n*Alignment done in Oct 2013\n*Radiator flush performed in Dec 2013\n*New battery installed about 2 years ago\nI still have the documentation/receipts for the majority of the above.\nThere are a couple issues that are fixable:\n*Air conditioning stopped working a couple years ago\n*Speedometer sticks & the temp gauge is not working but the odometer & gas gauge work just fine\nPrice on lower end of blue book value with above issues taken into account and is negotiable.\nPlease contact me via email but feel free to leave your phone number if you would prefer I call you.  Thank you for your interest!",

In the last 1,000 miles, rebuilt transmission by Automatic Rebuilding in Kimberly (new seals, gaskets, etc) no problems with it before, just wanted it to get freshened up while everything was out. New clutch, flywheel, pressure plate, pilot bushing, and throw-out bearing, along with new clutch lever, spring, boot, and bearing carrier. Replaced the master cylinder, slave cylinder, and hose. Godspeed coil over suspension all the way around. All new parts, over $2,000 invested in the last 1,000 miles. I love the car, and it runs and handles great, I'm just too damn big for it. My head hits the roof and my ass doesn't fit the seat. My loss is your gain. Clean and clear title. Asking $9,250 OBO. Call or Text Jake at 920-7one6-2five31",

    "body": "WINTER SPECIAL! Won't find a better Subaru deal! If you're looking for the best deal on a winter car or something you can drive year round reliably look no further!\n For sale is this rigorously maintained 2002 Subaru Impreza 2.5rs. This car, as you probably already know, is very highly respected for its all season drive-ability and durability. The oil has been changed every 4000 miles with Rotella T-6 most of its life and recently Lucas Oil Stabilizer. I haven't driven a better car in the winter. There's no major leaks, grinds, squeaks, or creaks just a clean nice ride. Not only does this model get you the awd but it's got great gas mileage and decent pickup for being a non-turbo. This car drives like it should. You wont be disappointed. It's fresh and ready to go for winter!\n Motor 8/10 (for the year its excellent full power no CEL runs flawless but does have 170k)\n Body 5/10 (plastidip, key scratches underneath dip, small dings)\n Drivetrain 8/10 (new fluids all around including the diff, but ever since the clutch kit was put in with the new release bearing and yoke, yet the release bearing makes an annoying wine)\n Interior 8/10 very clean! regularly shampooed(Bissell), vinyl protected with meguiras products and scotch guard seats. No pets and and smoke, so no stains and furr. Also includes original floor mats that are nice and clean.\n All the maintenance is up to par including:\n 1.) Gates Pro Timing belt kit Includes: \n -> 1 Belt, 1 Tensioner, 4 Idler Pulleys and a Water Pump.\n 2.) Cylinder head gasket kit by VR\n -> Engine Cylinder Head Gasket Set -- Cylinder Head Gasket Material: Multi-Layered Steel; Exhaust Manifold Gasket Material: VR2000; Intake Manifold Gasket Material: Paper; With Cylinder Head Bolts\n 3. Matching all season tires 60k tires with 50% wear currently all the way around (directional)\n 4. Iridium NGK IX spark plugs part number BKR6EIX-11\n 5. US AutoForce complete exhaust system headers back\n 6. Rhino Pac 15-019SR100 high performance clutch kit from weavers\n 7. Machined and stepped flywheel done by weavers\n 8. Rear brakes were changed 30k ago with cheapo pads from weavers but still work great\n 9. New front Federal Mogul sway bar endlinks\n 10. New Power Stop premium rotors and brake pads\n 11. Redline synthetic lightweight shockproof gear oil in the rear differential and new plug gaskets.\n FLAWS:\n This car isnt perfect body wise but its pretty nice considering the use it's got. Well worth the money.It was plasti dipped white and the hood and trunk still are but it doesnt look the best imo. The next weekend the weather is nice I was going to plasti dip it flat black. All of this however nothing mechanically important there isn't any concerning rust and its all around a solid car.\n ->This car is well taken care of; if anything, its over maintained. Most the work was done by previous owner at Dutches. I have contact with the mechanic who worked on this car if you would like to talk to him.\n REASON FOR SALE: My neighbor has had this beautiful dsm that ive had my eye on for years. He's willing to sell now and I want this gone ASAP willing to take a loss. Price is pretty firm unless you can find me a comparable 2.5rs for this price. The car will be cleaned detailed and sold with a half tank of gas. NO SURPRISES HERE.",

I love the truck and has done a very good job for my towing business but i am in need of a flat bed/rollback again. i am asking $14,200 and am firm on the price but i would be more interested in trading for a rollback. i would do a straight up trade for the right truck, or take a partial trade with cash from your end. i would need a truck ready to go mechanical as this is my only tow truck",

Over $10,000 in accessories were added to the car.  The car has low miles with 68,000 miles on the engine. The body is in need of some TLC.  I've included pictures of how it once looked when it was well cared for.  The car is now a project car needing some body work and a paint job.  The body has been shaved if all chrome, knobs and latches.  Smoked ANZO Projector Halo Headlights and custom tail lights.  The doors have been retro fitted and now open from the front(suicide doors) with remote key fobs.  The interior doors have custom molded fiberglass panels.  The hatchback contains molded fiberglass custom speaker mounts.  The engine is solid with performance headers and cam gears.  The engine needs nothing!  It has a brand new clutch, pressure plate and throw out bearing.  The gauges have a white background with indigo lighting.  Sliding sunroof/ moon roof.  It has Corbeau racing seats and  Italian MoMo steering. It has 18\" Racing Hart Evolution(very rare) rims and low profile tires.  I also have a brand new set of winter tires on Ford Focus rims that will be sold with the car. Much more than I can list here.  The high spoiler and the sound system have been removed.  This car would require very little to be the \"show\" car it once was. There will be no joy rides with this car, so only serious buyers need apply",

    "body": "2004 Chevy Silverado 4x4 Work Truck with 152,000 miles. \nTruck has a 4.8 V8 engine that is solid and the transmission has had no slips. I've hauled several loads without issues and the previous owner was a farmer from Wisconsin, who never had issues as well from what he said. It handles very well in snow and rain, along with driving on highway with strong winds and in a busy city.\nExterior color is Charcoal that is in great shape for being 10 years old. Minor rust on the rockers is all. Additions to the truck are the fender flares to help limit rust setting in on the wheel wells, chevy mud flaps and a new rear chrome bumper as the previous one was showing it's age. Also chrome slip covers on the rims as well. It looks pretty sharp! I would wash it every two weeks or so. The truck bed cover is NOT being sold with the truck.\nInterior has dark gray cloth seats with a front row bench and has no tears anywhere on the seats. With it being a Work Truck it does not have power seats, windows or locks. It does have a single CD player and the speakers sound great. Interior has been very well maintained as I would clean out once every two weeks or so.\nThe tires will make it through one more winter.\nThere is one thing that needs to be replaced that I chose not to, as I always have the windows down during summer, is the blower resister and wiring connector. It's quoted at $262.\nOther than that, this truck is in excellent condition all around. Would be great for someone needing a truck for work, pulling a camper/boat, for leisure, an extra vehicle, for college kid or even first timer driving. It's been durable, dependable and a nice truck to have.",

    "body": "Hello!  I'm selling/trading my 1985 Mazda RX7.  Completely stock/original 12A 1.1L rotary car that has never been modified, just maintained.  It even has the original stereo with the analog equilizer, and it sounds pretty damned good!  I am the 2nd owner.  The first owner bought the car in Texas in '85 where it stayed until 1995 when he moved up here.  It stayed in his garage until I bought it.  \nI really love this car, and want to keep it as my classic car to restore and just drive on weekends...it's a really great car for that.  But I can't currently give it the home it deserves, as I live in an apartment with no garage.  Prior to me buying it, it has only seen rain a handful of times, and has never seen snow.  It's really in fantastic condition for it's age, and it cleans up very nicely.  Did I mention that it's completely rust free!\nThe only issues it has are two very small chips in the windshield (not cracking), and a few minor cosmetic scratches and dings from living in a garage, but nothing bad at all.  All but one of the dings can be removed easily and without re-painting by a paintless dent removal (PDR) specialist.  Otherwise, the only thing it needs is regular maintenance!\nIt's only had two minor problems since I bought it.  It burst an aged coolant line.  It was turned off immediately, and never got hot.  When I replaced the heater hose, I also replaced the other coolant hoses, coolant, thermostat (10deg colder than stock), and water pump as a precaution.  It's also received a new fuel pump and filter.  She's been running like a champ ever since.\nPlease email or text if you're interested.  I'm asking $4,000OBO, and I'm open to considering trades. I'm looking for a '91-'95 or '00-'05 MR2, '00-'05 Celica, or other sports car.  Messages from spammers & scammers will be deleted immediately and without response.\nThanks for looking, and I hope you can give this beautiful car the home that I can't.  \nCheers!",

Spins the tires shifting into 2nd gear real nice!!\nThe interior is very nice, driver's seat has a tear on a seam, hence the seat covers, but passenger and rear are very nice. Dashboard is nearly perfect. No radio, but when you are listening to the big block rumble, who needs a radio anyway ;)\nCash price $3000.... If this were April, the price would be $7,000....I am loosing my winter storage, and have our first child on the way....and need to sell soon!  Come take advantage of my situation, and get this car for half price what you should be paying...I just need it gone, I've had my fun with it already.",

T-Tops w/ covers, Automatic transmission with 3:73 posi rear end rebuilt in 2012. I hardly ever drive this car since it is always in storage. New paint job done fall 2011 with professionally installed custom graphics kit and all new weather stripping.  Paint is 8/10. Interior is 7/10, 10 would be show quality. Headliner starting to sag a little by T-Tops and tear in drivers seat (normal). Power doors, locks, cruise control and antenna. Aftermarket stereo, speakers sound great! Has AC, but AC started blowing warm this year. New headlight motors. New Flowmaster dual exhaust. Clean title. K&N air filter. Car has front disc brakes and drum rear brakes. New tires with chrome rims. Rims may have a little surface rust on them due to storage but some polishing compound will get rid of that. Car serviced every time I would take it out of storage to drive. Never driven in Winter! Mechanically sound! New parts this year are radiator, ignition switch, and tune up.  Always ran premium fuel. Very reliable car! Never had any issues going on long trips. Since I don't drive this car as much as I should, I figure I would put it for sale and see who else can enjoy it. Car will come with some extra parts. I'm looking for $5,500 for the car. I love this car and don't absolutely need to get rid of it so Serious inquires only and no joy rides. Any questions about the car, please call \n \n\nThe pictures were taken right after washing the car, as you can tell there was still water on the hood...",

Oil was changed every 4-6000 miles. Always used John Deere premium oil (told by previous owner). \n- New ABS will be put on ASAP. \n-It has 3 LED light strips under the dash. Blue, green and red.\n- Aftermarket Bluetooth stereo.\n- Newer off-road tired and newer rims (stocks will go with the truck)\n- Chrome rocker Panels\n- Heavy duty mule hitch\n- Extra leaf spring was installed\n- Bedliner \n- Tow mirrors\n- LED tail lights\n- New injectors (about 20000 miles on them)\n- New Fuel pressure regulator\n- AFE stage II intake\n- Air Dog II 165 lift pump\n- Superchip 3 stage programmer\n- Pump rub has been fixed\n- Custom stainless steel 4 inch to a 6 inch tip exhaust (with a muffler, that can be removed if you wanted to)\nIt does have a little rust on the rockers but that's kinda normal for a truck this year in Wisconsin. Other than that nothing. Paint is pretty darn good. It's a very very clean truck with all the normal lb7 issues taken care of and much more. It's a great truck, I've loved it but it's time for something new. It's been very well maintained and I basically have every receipt and expense for this truck. I'm confident this truck is solid and sound. I'm asking at around 11k obo with everything that I've listed going with. I have clean title in hand.

    "body": "For sale is my 2008 Acura RL in white pearl metallic (difficult color to find) . It's in great condition.  Has Navigation and takes voice commands. Hands-free dialing. This is the flagship luxury Acura that was built to compete with the Lexus sedans. To say it is plush and refined is an understatement! I am the second owner. Most all service has been done by Zimbrick Madison. (I have receipts / records) Fresh oil change 9/6/14.  It's very safe in the rain and in winter having ALL WHEEL DRIVE. Power everything, wood inlay in the dashboard, runs and drive fantastically. HID headlights. Has the paddle shift option on the steering wheel if you are feeling sporty! It is garage kept but has a remote starter for leaving the office on cold days. New front brakes installed on 8/15/14 (rear pads have plenty of life on them yet).  Beige leather interior, electric shade for rear window - keeps the heat down. NON SMOKER!, Upgraded NAV disc with most current maps. Comes with both the Acura winter rubber floor mats and the carpet summer mats. Check out this review: http://usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/cars-trucks/Acura_RL/2008/\nAlso, USA Today on July 17th had an article praising specific cars that tested very safe, this is one of them. Great for a college student or another loved one.\nUtterly reliable and refined automobile. I am selling it as I am going back to a truck. Clear title in hand. Priced less than KBB.\nAccord, Honda, Lexus, Audi, Mercedes, Infinity, BMW",

It is a 2.7L 6cyl engine and an automatic transmission. The Limited edition is the top of the line Chrysler Sebring. The car has I think all options:  a/c, very nice factory stereo w/ CD player, power windows and locks, cruise control and tilt, power sunroof, heated leather seats, moon roof and aluminum wheels with good tires/breaks. It's very clean inside and out.\nI recently got a new car and the car is just sitting in the parking lot at my apartment complex and the building manager said I have until it snows to move it, But I would like it gone before then.\nI recently moved to Madison from Milwaukee,  I travel a lot for my job so showing it might be complex....but  my next door neighbor said he could help, If needed.\nIf you would like to see the car please call or email me, if I do not answer I will get back to you as soon as I can.",

It was my grandfathers before it was mine but im now getting a newer vehicle so its no longer needed and must go! The motor and transmission in this vehicle are not original and currently only have 120,000 on them. My grandfather and father swapped out the engine/trans and the lower mileage set in about 3 years ago, the body has 216,000 miles on it. Minimel rust, straight body with no dents. Really clean body for the year, the full mock convertable top is in good condition. It starts up everytime, runs, drives and stops excellent. Tires and brakes are good all around. The interior is fair, there's some cracking/rip in the front seats and on the drivers door panel. Has a droopy headliner but its all intact. All windows, lights and electronic components all work. Needs some work but none of it is major or anything that would prevent it from being driven everyday. I wouldnt hesitate to drive it anywhere, its a very reliable and strong running classic Cadillac. If it was perfect or mint it wouldnt only be $1200 so please dont show up expecting a $5000 car for this cheap.

Love the car but not in a good enough position to have a summer car. I have 3k into it and would like $2.5k. I am asking less than I paid for it because it has saved me over $1k in the last summer alone in fuel and the head is out. I would like to sell it to a collector or someone who wants to convert it to veg. Email and we can talk I always love talking with vw enthusiasts. Has the 1.6l with the 5 speed transmission. \nVideo of interior ad engine bay.\nhttp://youtu.be/Q6fGAJB8yMY\nText me for more pictures. I have hundreds.\nCheers",

This Mustang would be great for someone who appreciates classic cars, but doesn't want to spend a ton of time getting it in decent running condition or would like a first classic car to fully restore. The car has only been in the north (no farther then VA) for a year and was kept in the garage for the entire winter, and has never seen snow or salt. This is what some would call a 20 footer. From 20 feet off this car is beautiful; get up close and you can see some pitting and chipping. A decent paint job would make this car perfect. Both bumpers are in new condition and the engine runs perfect without a tick. The engine was rebuilt by a previous owner, but the body parts are all still original. The tires are in good condition and they are racing tires. There is a small leak in the coolant system, but it has been manageable. The reason for our selling is because we are raising money for a new and exciting entrepreneurial adventure.

The car is stock with the exception of a stereo system and 4 speaker system.  This HX has a 5 speed manual transmission, power mirrors, power door locks, power windows, and air conditioning, which blows strong and cold- A/C is unique with the HX models. I have service records showing the work I have had done and records from the previous owner. The timing belt and water pump only have 10k, the brakes, spark plugs, anti-freeze, belts, hoses, tires and filters are all up to date and in very good condition. As the records show, many of the previous items I have just replaced both doors' run channels- frames, gaskets, and window regulators.  The car really needs nothing and is ready to go.  It has made several trips between McFarland and Green Bay, Platteville and Green Bay and McFarland to South Carolina.  The mpg was 40+ and the car performed flawlessly.  Please contact me for more information or to schedule a time to see the car and to drive the car. Make me an offer.",

The mileage may increase slightly as I do drive it around town and to work, oh, and to church on sundays!. It is HARDLY a truck for me, since I have to grab the roll bars just to get in, and the girlfriend said it isn't sitting in the driveway for 4 years, so it is up for sale.  I will listen to SERIOUS offers only but am negotiable, and NO I don't want to trade for anything, thanks. The whole idea of selling it is to free up the driveway, not add anything else.

We operate our business on a high volume, low price model, which means our prices are very often the lowest prices you'll find.

    "body": "Hello, I am selling my 1997 Acura Cl 2.2 5 speed manual. It has just over 196k on it. I just had the Timing belt, water pump, balance shaft belt, front crankshaft seal, camshaft seal and valve cover gasket replaced by a Honda Tech recently. The car is in absolute great shape, the underneath is solid with no rust. I work at a Honda dealership so I've had it up in the air countless of times and everything underneath is solid and clean. The only rust on the car is on the drivers rear quarter. The car runs and drives flawlessly, shifts smooth and gets great gas mileage. Tires and brakes are in great shape and are relatively new. The only things wrong with the car is that the metal lines on the steering rack for the power steering have cracked (only one of the two lines is cracked but I got both because you might as well just replace both lines while your at it), I have both OEM Honda lines for it and a couple bottles of Honda Power Steering fluid to go with the car. Other then the power steering, the only other thing wrong with it is that one tire has a slow leak. I have it listed for $2200 OBO. If you have any other questions or want to view the car you can either Email me, text me or call me. Texting or emailing would be the best but if you call and I don't answer just leave a message.\nI am buying a new car so I'm mainly looking to sell. Don't be afraid to throw out offers, I would like to sell as soon as possible, no need for the extra car anymore.\nNumber is under the contact drop down above\nThank you",

Full disclosure: this car is not in mint condition, but if you have some mechanical ability or are willing to spend a little at a mechanic, you'll have a solid car. I'm still driving it every day between Verona and Madison (so it's still totally functional) and have loved this car for many years (so it's vouched for and has been cared for). Please note all of the very honestly detailed issues below and only call or write if you're aware of them. \nThe good:\n- Engine is solid and can run for many more miles. Mechanics say it's still ticking with the best of 'em.\n- Newer tires\n- New windshield wipers\n- Carefully maintained (regular oil changes etc.)\n- It's a solid car that's gotten me everywhere I've needed to go. Hasn't needed anything beyond oil changes, new tires, and brakes for 75,000 miles.\nThe bad:\n- Rust (note pictures). Normal for Subies of this age. \n- Needs CV joint/boot work\n- Needs new front right wheel bearing\n- Front new left tie end rod\n- Air conditioning is out (and has been for two years... but has great wind conditioning when you open the windows)\n- Sticky lock on the hatchback\nOne mechanic quoted the work somewhere between $1,200 and $1,700, depending on what you got fixed. But as we all know, those prices change dramatically depending on who you're talking to. \nSo that's it. $1500 or best offer. Not needing to unload it super quickly. I'll remove this post when it's sold. \nAnd good luck shopping for cars. I know this process sucks.",

    "body": "This listing is for my 1971 Chevelle Malibu 4-door sedan that I  purchased in 2006. I have put a lot of work into this car and I hate to see it go, but I just bought something that is a bit more conventional at this point and could use the extra room in my garage. I just don't have time for it any more, unfortunately. I had it running a few months ago at the beginning of summer, but the battery has died and so it's just sitting in my garage right now. I'm putting this ad up to see if the interest is there and if it's worth getting out of the garage. It's worth more than I'm asking for it, and definitely has more than what I'm asking for into it! $3,800 cash is very fair and very FIRM price, no wiggle of any kind. So don't waste either of our time if you're gonna try to change that. Pictures on this ad were taken last year. It looks the same now, just dusty from being inside.\n-62,872 Original Miles\n-307 V8\n-Clean title \nThe color is a dark blue that has flashes of purple, gold and green in the sun. I helped paint this car myself from it's ugly stock green color that it was when I got it. All of the striping was also done on\nmy own. The body is solid, doors close solid. \nThe tires are new, as well as the rims, however I do have the original tires/rims (there are 5 total) also available. They come with the original baby moon hubcaps which are all in really decent shape. Even if you don't use them, it's a good investment having the original parts with the car! You can see the caps in the trunk picture, along with tons of replacement and original parts that were purchased or removed during the overhaul a few years ago.\nI have replaced the radiator, many hoses and belts, carburetor, lights, as well as removed the engine for a full tune up and re-paint. The wheel wells have also been re-coated/painted (you can somewhat see the orange behind the picture of the tire.) \nThe only thing that needs to be done other than a new battery is a full break flush and a new gasket in the brake fluid housing. The rubber gasket can be purchased for a few dollars and it is seriously a 2 minute repair that is located right under the hood. Just pop open the housing, take out the\nold, warped gasket and put in the fresh one. The car has not been driven much in the last year, so a tow may be the safest way to get it home, although backing in and out of my driveway seems fine, the\nbreaks just feel a little spongy. The fluid may have gotten a little moisture inside with the bad gasket, hence the needed break fluid flush.\nThe engine is a purring 307 V8. Really decent gas mileage for as much pick up as it's got. I drove from Wausau to Madison in a half a tank! With the extended body in the 4-door model and extra storage in the rear, it's surprising just how much get up and go the smooth running engine packs.\nThe steering column is obviously not stock, it was a repair that was done before I got the vehicle. The blinkers work, but there is a slight wiring issue inside and they don't work if you push the blinker\nrod all the way down, you just have to push it slightly. It's a silly little thing, but I know this car inside and out and I want to be honest with everything up front!\nI have the inside pretty basic and cleaned out, the floor is gutted at the moment, and was planning on getting it all re-done with bucket seats in front and keeping the bench in back, however you can do\nwhatever you would like with it. The back seat isnt fastened at the moment, but can easily be pressed in and it won't go anywhere. (it's only 2 screws if you really needed it fastened down) The upholstery in the front leaves a lot to be desired, that is why I have a seat cover on it at the moment. The body and overall drive-ability was my number one priority after I got the car, and so the inside hasn't had much work done to it. I had a full quote done about 2 years ago for a basic interior for under a grand. So if you did it yourself or shopped around more, I'm sure you could get way cheaper than that.\nI am only looking to deal in person and in cash, so don't offer to send checks or money orders or any of that. Feel free to contact me anytime, I am gone most weekends for work, but you can call me and I can answer any questions you might have and set up a time for you to come look at it.\nSIX-ZERO-EIGHT-SEVEN-SEVEN-TWO-NINE-ZERO-TWO-FIVE, ask for Eric, or just text which is preferred. (I had to type out my phone number because I've been getting non-stop\nspam calls from bots. Sorry about that.)\nEverything is being sold AS-IS, as this is an older vehicle and I am not a dealership. I am located on the west side of Madison. You will have to put a bit of work into this car to finish it, and the price reflects that.\nThank you for taking time to read through my listing, and again, feel free to contact me anytime.

At the same time it had the seats re upholstered the vinyl floor was replaced with brand new vehicle specific black carpeting along with new floor mats. The windows have been tinted professionally and Cary a lifetime warranty. The front brakes have been replaced ( pads and rotors). New starter. New serpentine belt and idler pulley. New front grill( due to a crack). Mustang built wheels with working tpms sensors and very good condition Pirelli tires.Various other things were repaired such as an oil cooler gasket due to an oil leak and a shifter button for the overdrive lock out. Mind you all of this was done within the last 6k! With receipts for everything. There is one small dent in the car and a couple scratches other than that its beautiful. You will not find a car better taken care of. It also comes with the factory steel wheels, center caps and lug nuts, the tires on the steel wheels are 4/32nds(mostly shot).

I'm selling this because I'm a student who works full time and just needs a vehicle to get me from work and school and back home. I don't need my dream vehicle yet, because I do love this jeep. It's ideal for winter because of the amazing 4wd, and also fun to take the top off in the summertime. There are some cosmetic damages like SMALL paint chips and also the left front fender in bent in a little. I'm selling for under KBB value because I'm hoping to sell it very fast.

First person with cash in hand owns it. Looking to sell this weekend, may consider the right trade plus cash.  Retail value is still close to $5,000 - so save big now before snow hits and the price for 4x4s jump.  Thanks for looking!",

Never seen winter and barely ever seen rain. The soft top is new from this summer. Tires need to be changed soon, new oil and brakes. Car shifts smoothly and starts first crank every time. Lights go up and down. This is the model A addition with the LSD and power windows, badges are in great shape. Paint is in great shape but a light sun faded, interior is phenomenal no tears in seat, non-smoking, a little tear in the shift boot. Burn no oil!

Specifically, it's leaking oil (but only when it's running), has non-functioning rear brakes, and doesn't have a stereo or speakers. The driver's seat has a tear in the leather, has some discolored paint, and the left rear door sometimes takes a few tries to unlock (unless you reach around and unlock from the inside, then it works fine). There are also some dents and scratches here and there, but nothing that is scratched down to the metal. The check engine light is on, and the computer says it's a stuck EGR valve. The title is clear, but there is no registration or insurance on it, so any test drives would be 100% your liability. This sale is stricktly AS-AS! Even with all that said, the tires and rims alone bring it somewhat close to the asking price! 2 sets of keys and keyless entry keychains. Please email me with any questions.",

    "body": "Details on the car. . .\n- It is a California 1957 VW Ghia with a clean title.\n- Matching numbers on Body and Pan.\n- It looks like quite some time ago that the Original (LowLight) front end was changed out to a 60's style due to a fender bender. It is only the outer skin portion of the front clip as it retains all the 1957 metal inside the front trunk and the inner fender wells. The repair was welded all along the inside lip of where the front trunk seal lays.\n- The nose is straight and clean  even from looking on the inside.\n- The inner front and rear fender wells look to be in good shape.\n- The car has all the glass (front, rear, rear quarters and door glass).\n- There is some rust on the bottom of the front fenders, along the outer rocker skins and in the rear lower quarters (where the rear bumper wraps around to the sides).\n- There is a small quarter size rust hole under the front hood by the gas tank passenger side.\n- The heater channels and door sills appear to be solid all around. There is some surface rust but they are not soft in the least.\n- The engine compartment metal is solid except for the passenger side battery tray, which is typical on all Ghia's at some point in their life.\n- Doors are solid along with fully functional internal mechanisms.\n- Has the Original uncut dash without gas gauge hole and radio blank off plate.\n- Has the Original year correct steering wheel.\n- All the interior color is in Original \"Toucan Black\" with a patina.\n- It has the very early heater controls (1956), which is a knob on each side of the dash compared to the later 2 levers on the driver side (1957 and up).\n- The car is fairly straight. There is a dent in the passenger rear quarter by the tail light and in the drivers front fender just behind and below the headlight.\n- The engine and gearbox looks to be updated. It looks like a 40hp engine with a split-case gearbox. The engine spins and the gearbox does shift. I have paperwork from a previous owner that shows the engine being rebuilt in the mid to late 1980's (1986-1988). The last time is looks to be registered for the road is 1991 in California.\n- The pans should be replaced or patched (rear pans for sure and some of the passenger front pan).\n- Since it has been off the road for some time I'm sure all the mechanicals, linkages, brakes, suspension, etc. . . need to be gone over.\n- Electrically it looks like the car is still 6 volts.\n* Mileage listed in the Description above is not exact.\nParts that I know are missing and may or may not be a big deal to some prospective buyers.\n- passenger side front fender badge\n- rear deck lid script\n- interior visors\n- headliner (it does come with the metal bows which holds up the fabric portion of the headliner)\n- side exterior trim (12 pieces)\n- chrome front windshield trim\n- door sill plates\n- nose badge\n- rear (back seat) interior cards\n- needs window seals\n- there will be other misc. weather stripping and seals that will need to be replaced just based on the age of the car\nParts off the car that are included in the sale.\n- front, rear and side quarter windows (the door glass is still installed)\n- Original hubcaps (4).\n- complete headlight assemblies\n- partial taillight assemblies (one lens is broke, the other is missing and one trim is cracked)\n- interior door cards\n- rear seat (bottom and back)\n- front seats (need be reupholstered)\n- rear license plate light housing\n- front and rear blade bumpers (rear has some toe hooks installed)\n- misc. nuts and bolts from parts removed\nPLEASE click on my PhotoBucket link to get a detailed look at the car:    http://s46.photobucket.com/user/csowers/slideshow/1957%20VW%20Ghia\nAlso click on the LowLight Registry link for VIN information:    http://www.kglowlightregistry.com/index.php?action=listingview&listingID=655\nI have explained the condition of the car as completely as I can and along with the pictures I am hoping you can get a good assessment.\nPlease ask any questions you feel necessary in making an educated decision.\niPhone iPod iMac macbook shuffle touch vw ghia low light lowlight iPad",

    "body": "For sale is my 1981 VW Rabbit (MK1) diesel. I've had this red 4-door hatch for just a little bit over a year in hopes of converting it over to veg oil, but school and other obligations have gotten in the way of that. The body has only a few minor flaws and the diesel engine has 82,000 miles original. I looked up the Car Fax on the vehicle before I bought it and it was registered to WI in 2005 from NJ with 59,000 miles.\nThere isn't much that this car needs. Last fall I had the head gasket redone, and replaced the water pump as well as a full set of new tires and a battery. There may be all of 5,000 miles on the tires. What does need to be done are all very minor jobs. RH mirror is cracked, but usable. The struts for the hatch could probably stand to be replaced as they don't always independently support the weight of the hatch. The interior needs only ceiling fabric. The car was repainted at some point before, as the red tone is one that was used on Beetles in the late 60's. It could probably use a good buff, and a small touch-up on the hood. VERY minor. There are only a few very small rust spots near where the trim anchors to the body. This car has a working moonroof (original), however it must have leaked. I bought the car basically as-is, and the moonroof was sealed shut with silicone. Inconvenient, but fixable. The engine leaks a little oil at the crankshaft seal as well. Fairly easily fixed.\nFeel free to ask me questions about the car. I'll be happy to answer any questions I can. Email is preferred. Pics will be posted soon.\nI'm only selling this car as I could use the money, and have recently realized that I do not have the time to spend on this car as I had hoped. I love this little car and would love to see it spend some time with a collector.",

    "body": "I have a 1986 Chevy S-10 lowrider truck that was built in the early to mid 1990's. It has been completely taken apart to sandblast the frame, which was sprayed with epoxy primer and undercoating. The body of the truck was painted inside and out to remove any factory color. There is a flush matching fiberglass tonneau cover that was never installed. 15\" custom aluminum wheels (which was a big wheel size at the time) with low profile tires. It has Toyota MR2 seats installed on a custom metal frame that uses the existing mounting configuration. There is a freshly built small block 305 with TBI installed with a rebuilt 700R4 transmission installed with shortened and balanced drive shaft and spliced TBI wiring harness and computer installed (the harness is on the engine and routed inside the cab when it was test fired up but needs to be done permanently). Needs an entire exhaust and steering shaft to be complete. Back in the mid 90's this engine was fired up once and I never quite completed the project. Unfortunately having sat this long... it's hard to determine the state of the engine and drive train. The body and frame are top notch and the paint job on the body and frame itself is worth more than I will ever get out of the sale. I need to find a home with someone hopefully motivated to get it back on the road.\nThe pictures (digital picture of a picture) included are the truck when it was running with the original 2.4 liter engine. It has the analog dash (not the digital). Factory AC Delco CD player.\nAlso in the intermediate.... between the 4 cylinder and V8 I had rebuilt a 2.8 MPFI and installed it but never ran it. That would come with the purchase also.\nIt has always been stored in a garage since the rebuild and has a thick layer of dust on it. It has been sitting on the factory steel 14\" wheels since being stored with the 15\" aluminum sitting in the bed of the truck.\nMy price is at $4900..\nTrades considered; vintage air-cooled VW, BMW / English motorcycles, 60's 70's Harley, LowLight Ghia but cash is preferred.\nHave any questions..... Please fire away.\nThanks for looking.\niPhone iPad iMac MacBook iPod touch Apple TV",

One set on ebay now for $599 without tires! The SC-901 Volvo multi disc cd player is worth $150 on ebay. The Volvo amplifier in the trunk is also $150.

Dealer said it could come early or it could be late; they can't promise it will arrive for sure on the 17th. The sale of this vehicle will have to be completed when my new car arrives, and before I actually purchase the new car, so that I have the cash from this sale for part of my down payment.\n3.4L V6 Engine\n4 speed auto transmission\nCD player\nCruise Control\nABS brakes\nAir conditioning\nDual air bags\nAlloy (maybe aluminum-not sure) 5 spoke wheels\nTires have 15,000 miles on them. Rated for 60,000 mile.\nFront Brake pads installed at 113,000 miles\nNew front rotors (9/30/14)\nRear Brake pads and rotors installed at 113,000 miles\nAir filter new at 130,000 miles (good for 12K)\nNew oil and filter (9/30/14)\nNew plugs and wires somewhere around 80K miles I think\nNew interstate battery last winter\nAvg about 22mpg city and as high as 30mpg highway \nPower locks, windows, and mirrors\nKeyless entry with 1 faub, Second key, but it will only unlock the doors. It doesn't have the anti-theft chip in it.\nVery Minor Scrape/dent front right- barely noticeable (noted and circled in one of the pics above), as well as, the usual dings and scratches cars get over the years.\nI was checking the coolant system density and the coolant cap broke, so that is new (9/30/14) as well. Coolant density is good to -35 degrees F. All other fluids have been checked and capped off.\nI'm the second owner of this car (I'm fairly sure). Bought it in 2004 in Harvey, LA with 32K miles on it. The oil has been changed every 3K miles by myself and does not leak oil other than the normal crud build up on engines that develops over this many miles. I put new tires on it 2 falls ago, and thought I would have this care for another five years at least, but with a baby on the way soon, I need something with 4 doors and newer safety features. I priced this car based on Kelly Blue Book and NADA pricing for Retail which for \"Good Condition\" was $3052 and $3700 Respectively. I've taken good care of this car over the last 10+ years and if you continue to do so, you should a number of years of hassle free driving.",

Has a small coolant leak at intake ( I think).  I was told the motor is out of a 60s car and the car was painted about 4 years ago. Drum brakes front & rear with plenty of life left. Tires are good. Frame is solid and floor & trunk pan are good. It had exhaust coming out in front of rear tires, but now has single out the rear. It's quiet. I get a lot of thumbs up every time I take it out. Has a few little flaws. It is not a show car but it does turn heads. We like to call it our Sunday cruiser.  It does need interior , needs seats recovered, headliner, etc. You can drive as is, restore or just rat rod. May possibly trade for older Harley bagger 0r a decent lifted 4+4 truck. You can reach me by phone, but please, NO TEXT. I DO NOT TEXT. Or contact me through CL.",

    "body": "Maroon 4-speed manual '77 Datsun 280Z 2.8L RWD Coupe for sale. Fully paid for, legally licensed, and insured in WI. Asking $4000 obo. \nCurrently running great. I'm the third owner, had it for over a year and kept it in the garage most of the time - driving it only when sunny and nice. Engine has been replaced by second owner - original owner overheated the engine and melted a cylinder head. It then sat in his garage collecting dust until the second owner bought and replaced engine. It is an older car and things go wrong. I have personally had to replace clutch master and slave cylinders, fix a few fuel lines, replace the fuel injection pressure regulator and few other more minor things. I have recently replaced fuel filter, oil filter, air filter, and all the spark plugs. Car has been repainted since its original white by the first owner (a good choice I think). Now a very 70's maroon. As any older car living in Wisconsin it has some rust and some chips here and there, most notably in the hood, but otherwise pretty nice on the exterior. I have ripped out carpet as it was getting very old and smelling bad (and it let me inspect it much more thoroughly), only left the drivers floor carpet intact. Leather seats have some wear but overall good, as seen in pictures. Leather panelling inside is certainly a highlight of car as its still in great shape and looks pretty good. Front dashboard has about 2\" length by .1\" width crack down the center. Only modifications I have made is to replace the non-original speaker head unit and speakers (I believe the original was taken out by the first owner). Odometer has stopped at 83k but my best estimate is that its not over 100k (probably closer to 90k). Drivers side door lock does not unlock. Does have some unibody rust as well, so probably not the best choice for a restoration car.\nThats a lot, and everything I can think of currently. Trying to get rid of this car in the next few months so I'm willing to hear offers on it. I've loved owning this car and hope it finds a good home.",

The body has been filled, shaved, louvered hood, custom paint, Boyd wheels, and lowered. Because I haven't driven it much it could use a little TLC.

The vehicle is lien-free.\nIt is an automatic with a powerful 4 cylinder engine, power locks, power windows, CD player, air conditioning and the body is in great overall shape. The car has one notable issue -- it keeps drinking coolant and appears to either need a bleeding of air bubbles from the cooling system and/or a flush.\nIt doesn't overheat and the one air bleed session I completed helped for a while, but it didn't solve the issue. The car doesn't blow warm air at idle because the cooling system is affected, but it does blow warm air when driving down the road. I am asking $3,500.\nA few buyer/seller FYIs -- I will ride along on a test drive and answer questions the best I can. For payment I will accept cash as well as a cashier's check directly from the hands of a local bank if you are taking out a loan for the vehicle.

This Escalade has only 50,5xx miles on it which is very low for these vehicles and it's very clear this Cadillac has been well cared for.This Escalade Hybrid looks great and has a TON to offer! Under the hood is a 6.0L V8 and two electric hybrid motors that combine for 332HP and a ton of torque so you can tow your boat or camper with ease! When driving in town this Escalade uses mainly the electric motors so you will get right around 20MPG which is nearly double that of a regular gas engine, and it uses cylinder deactivation when driving on the highway so it cuts power to 4 cylinders to get you great MPG on the highway too!\nThis Escalade has some fantastic options, like the heated and cooled seats which are incredible! In the summer they stay cool and this time of the year the heated seats are perfect! They heat up fast and make a cold morning drive so much better. This Cadillac also has the touchscreen navigation system, a 10-speaker BOSE audio system that gives you a great surround sound feeling, and the rear seat DVD entertainment system that is perfect for road trips. Just grab a handful of DVDs and you can keep the kids (and adults!) quiet and entertained for hours on end. For full size pictures and more details go to www.CapitalMotorCompany.com.

It has all the seats (less common than you might think) and a Class III trailer hitch with a 4-pin wiring connector.  The dual front and rear A/C and heat all work great.  I've changed the oil with Mobil 1 High Mileage Synthetic ever since I've had it.  There is a check engine light on from an EGR code - that's the code you don't have to worry too much about.  The body is in slightly rough shape w/ some rust and surface scratches, as well as black paint bars over where the previous owners covered up the name of their church.  Yes, it used to be a church van :)\n156K miles is still low for a van like this, and it'll run great for a long time with the recent fixes put in to it.

    "body": "PLEASE READ THE ENTIRE AD!!!!\n1994 Chevy Caprice Stationwagon with the LT1 engine (Corvette Motor). It has a little rust, but it isn't a rust bucket. This car rides smooth and gets reasonably good gas mileage. It gets better gas mileage than my Daughter's mini van. It has 146,117 miles on it! It has the third seat and seats 8 people. The following parts have been replaced on it since we have owned it. Water pump, water pump drive shaft, radiator, front right ball joint and right rear lower control arm. The only reason we are selling it is because the air conditioner pulley is shot and we don't have time to work on it. I have a bypass pulley for it. It will have to be trailered because of the compressor being out! This is not a slap it on and drive away project. If that was the case I, myself, would do it even if my Husband didn't. If you think that just because I'm a woman and that I don't know what I'm talking about, do some research. Look up how to remove the air compressor pulley from a 94 LT1 engine. It DOES RUN!!! It starts up fine. The frame has rust, but it's still a strong and solid frame! We have clean title in hand.  Asking $700 cash. NO LOWBALLERS!! $700 is as low as I will go. No I will not come down any lower just because it needs work. No you can not fix it in my yard to drive it home, it needs to be trailered!!! Email with more questions or if your interested. I will get back to as soon as I can. \nI don't mean to sound like a complete witch, I'm just tired of everybody texting me asking my why this can't be driven home, or if they can put this pulley on in my driveway, then drive it home! I've been working on cars since I was a kid, if I had the time I would do it. I just don't have the time, nor does my Husband. If your gonna offer me lower, I will just demo it next year at the Warren fair.\nThis is cash in hand transaction. I will not take cashiers check or money order. I will also not ship it anywhere. Person to person transaction. Sorry I'm getting too many people wanting me to ship this!\nAlso this is first person with cash, first person that will get it. I will not hold it until the second Tuesday of next week. I'm not trying to sound like a witch, just I have learned from experience that this does not pan out well. Thanks",

Cutting edge has never seen pavement except in the garage.  Has double sided cutting edge one can flip over to use the other side when first side is worn (unlike the single sided cutting edge on today's new ones). No lights or mount - just the plow with the medium length 35\" A-frame complete with 3 springs & unused rams. Complete and ready to hook-up to any Western unimount setup.

We had a Viper Security System with remote start installed and comes with a key fob. It currently has 106,600 miles and the mileage will change because we still use it. We bought it when it only had 17K miles and 90% of the miles are highway miles and we are the 2nd owner of this off-lease car. All the maintenance was done on schedule with synthetic oils and it even recently had the transmission oil flush as well. It had new brakes installed all around in June of 2014 and the tires all have good thread left. The SUV drives good and has always been a trouble-free and reliable car for us. We are selling because we bought a new car and no longer needed. The paint on the driver's side mirror started to peel and the rear bumper has some scratches, other than that the exterior of the car shows very well. The interior is also in good condition.\nWe'd like to get what we owe on the car, which is nearly $2000 less than the KBB.com price for a private party sale. This would make a wonderful and reliable vehicle for someone. Please feel free to ask any questions and I could show you the car in Mt. Horeb or West Madison.",

It has factory air conditioning, everything is there but not working right now, power steering, perfect vinyl bench seat interior, 283 V8 with a powerglide automatic transmission,  Very original car!! It does leak some oil. It has a new windshield, new intake gaskets, rebuilt Carb, new Custom Autosound AM/FM/Cassette radio and near new tires and Monroe Air Shocks. The car was repainted maybe 20 years ago but does need paint and does have a few small holes in the hood where I can only imagine battery acid must have gotten trapped at some time. There is also some minor bubbling where the a/c drain is inside the right fender and very small amount on left quarter behind wheel well. Wheel wells are perfect as is most of the rest of the car including almost all trim.  Probably one of the most rust-free cars you will ever see in the Midwest!! I don't need help selling this car and may consider trades...depending on what you may have. I could trade up or down for something that's done. Maybe older Chevy truck, ElCamino, or other cool cruiser. Has to be dependable and need minimal or no bodywork. This is a really nice Chevelle with a CLEAR Wisconsin Title. I don't have to sell it so dont waste my time with  STUPID Offers. Thanks.",

The engine and transmission were both rebuilt in 1990, but they only have 42K miles on them. Has the 500cid V8 and TH400. Previous owner had a shift kit installed.\nIt has a bit of rust on it. The worst is around the back window and the edges of the vinyl top. It has a bit of rust behind the right rear wheel in the quarter panel and the fender skirt. Also has a small spot underneath the trim behind the front wheels. Paint is fairly nice though it does have blemishes and nicks. The vinyl top needs to be reglued behind the sunroof.  The wide whitewall tires are no longer on the car.  One blew out, and another developed a split in the sidewall.   It has 2 brand new tires on the front, and will come with another matching pair if sold.\nThe drivers window is the only one that works. One of the 4 horns doesn't work. The power antenna did work but the cord inside the antenna broke. Ignition key does not always turn easily and needs to be wiggled around sometimes to get it to turn.\nEverything else works including the A/C. Its been converted to R134a. Interior is nice but has some stains on the roof. Steering wheel is worn and cracked. The exhaust on it is ok, but it could stand to be replaced. Car is wired for towing a trailer, but theres no hitch. Cruise Control works but it doesn't always engage.  \nBoth front calipers were rebuilt, and all the brake hoses are new. Has new U-joints on the back of the drive shaft. Has a new horn relay. The battery is just over a year old.  The original floor mats are in the trunk.  \nI use this car to drive back a forth between Southern IL and WI twice a month.  Its about a thousand mile round trip every time and its never given me trouble.  \n$4500 or I would trade for a small piece of property within approximately 40 miles of Mount Horeb out in the country.",

It would make a great winter beater. It is a great car in the snow. It has a great heater in it. The interior is in excellent shape. The outside shows it is a 1990 in Wisconsin. But in overall it is still a great runner. I haven't driven it for awhile but have started it up and drove it once in awhile. It starts right up with no problems. Sorry my computer will not let me put a pic on here. Don't know why but oh well. I guess if interested you could come look at it or I could try sending you a pic on my phone which doesn't send good pics because it is not a smart phone.",

Tires are a little under half tread. The body has rust, mostly on front fenders, but I sanded it all down and repainted with Rust Oleum Rust Inhibitor primer and then rust oleum spray paint.

This is most likely the cleanest RX-7 youll ever find anywhere! Mazda RX-7 was one of the first cars using the rotary Wankel type engine, which gives you incredible smoothness.  Here is a little history of this particular car: it was purchased brand new from a Mazda dealership in 1984 by a doctor, who treated this car like his baby. He drove it only between May and November, putting less than 2000 miles on the car every year. He kept mileage records in the book. He changed oil every year and car was parked it in a heated garage for the whole winter. This little Mazda has never seen snow in its life! When garaged it was always covered up. He drove it only with sheep skin covers on the original seats! List of recent repairs include: BRAND NEW CLUTCH, NEW CLUTCH MASTER AND SLAVE CYLINDERS, LOWER CONTROL ARMS, NEW BATTERY, RETROFITED (R134a) AC SYSTEM. This car, even though its a 29 year old antique, drives like a brand new car, you can use it as a daily driver any time! Car is 100% original, no aftermarket parts, real time capsule!\nThis is a top of the line edition of RX-7, comes with power windows, leather interior, cruise control and premium radio! Car comes with two removable roofs: metal and glass. \nBody is in amazing condition. You wont find any dents or rust anywhere. Paint shines like new. Only a few very minor dings and scratches on the body, not even visible.\nInterior is super extra clean. Never smoked in. Leather in close to perfect condition, with only very minor signs of wear. \nIf youve been looking for RX-7 for a while now, and you really want to own a super cool car  this one is the way to go. Im getting thumbs up everywhere I show up in this car. People will stop to ask you questions about. This is just one of the coolest cars money can buy!\n\n\nVehicle Options\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\nMroczek Motors of Madison, \n117 Columbus St., \nSun Prairie,  \nWI,  \n53590, \n(CALL OR TEXT) 608-770-4884     ,Visit us on the web at www.motorsofmadison.com.

    "body": "1992 Saab 900 Turbo Convertible. 4 Cylinder Turbo Engine, 5 Speed Manual Transmission. White exterior, black convertible top, gray leather interior. --186,259 miles\nCAR NEEDS WORK TO MAKE IT SAFE TO DRIVE BUT RUNS AND MOVES AS IS RIGHT NOW.\nCar is rough in some areas and not bad in other areas. Top down photo was taken in July 2012. All other photos were taken on October 5, 2014.\nI purchased the car in March of 2009 from a guy in Kenosha. The car has lived all over the country from New Jersey to Oregon to Florida. I have the car fax report that I can email to anyone interested.\nThe car was my \"winter driver\" for a number of years. I put a loving 40,000 miles on the car with very little trouble. Many repairs have been done over the years and I have reciepts for them. All repairs have been done at Country Imports Specialty Saab shop in Neosho, WI. The last repair was a new alternator and a new battery.\nIn the beginning of June 2013, the car was parked on Langdon Street in Downtown Madison. At around 3 AM, someone took a box cutter to the convertible top and made two 8 inch cuts into it. They broke into the car, and took a screw driver to the glove box and snapped the latch. They got away with a $10 MP3 player that was locked in the glovebox. Before this time, the top was in really good shape and the insurance would not cover the damages. I did replace the glove box latch parts. The top was taped up with black Gorilla tape at the cuts and it is mostly water tight. The car has been sitting inside since August 2013 and has been driven about 100 miles in the past year.\nThe car runs and drives fine, however there are some issues:\nThe power steering rack has always leaked and last year while the car was sitting something on the rack failed and now the power steering is very stiff. I have not had time to look into it further. Fluid level is full and was always checked and maintained when I was driving it. The pump should still be good but it may need a rack.\nThe car needs new brakes, pads and rotors, on all 4 wheels--this was me trying to squeeze every dime out of it when times were tougher last year. When driving the car right now, the brakes are grinding. This is the primary reason it has not been driven much at all in the last 14 months.\nWhile the front tires are new, the rear tires (both) need to be replaced.\nThe exhaust system came apart just a little to the rear of the catalyic converter. The CAT is 100% fine, the car just needs the cat back portion of the exhaust replaced.\nIf you shift it quickly, the car grinds a little going into 2nd gear. If you shift it slowly, it will never grind at all. I had the intention of putting synchroshift fluid into the transmission but never got that far.\nThe interior is in fair shape with the usual Saab dash cracks and the like. The seats are from the era in 1992 where Saab was experimenting with different leather suppliers and this was one of the cars affected by quality issues. The leather dried out from the Florida sun during the years it was there and then the seams split. The leather seats are split at the seams. See the photos.\nThis car has been a very loyal and reliable car. I have had it sitting for 14 months with the intention of fixing and driving it again. I hate to see it parted out, but that may be the best use of it for the future. The exterior body is in very good shape with very little rust. Engine is also in excellent running condition and the turbo spools without any issues. The air conditioning compressor belt was cut and the A/C disconnected because it was R12 and no longer worked.\nThis would be a great project car for someone to get it into decent shape. I am hoping to sell it to someone that will either use the parts or someone that will fix it and my last ditch effort will be for scrap to the junkyard. The car currently also has Wisconsin Collector Registration/plates.",

The paint is beautiful, with the exception of a small rust spot (more details to follow). No accidents. Windshield is in great condition, with one very small chip on the outside. \nRecent repairs include coolant undercarriage piping (July 2014), air conditioning system refresh (July 2014), new Cooper tires (March 2014), water pump and timing gasket cover replacement (February 2014), starter replacement (December 2013). \nRegular oil changes. Consistent pass in vehicle emissions inspections (I'm originally from the Milwaukee area). \nThere is a small rust spot above the driver's side rear wheel. A picture is included. Apparently this is a weakness in all 2002 Taurus models. \nIn July 2014, a coolant pipe rusted through, causing the vehicle to overheat. My mechanic repaired and tested the vehicle, with the finding that the engine was not harmed in any way. \nOverall, this has been a safe and reliable mode of transportation!",

    "body": "First off, if you haven't owned an original rabbit before you are truly missing out. Secondly, if you don't know anything about vehicles, much less diesel, this car is probably not for you.\nIt is the 'extremely rare' 5 speed manual, which allows you to put all 1.6l and 52 factory HP to work. This thing truly does want to cruise at 65mph all day long and get 50mpg while doing it. The engine has approximately 250,000 miles - I would know exactly if the the odometer worked...or if it had an odometer...or a speedometer. But the engine was rebuilt at 180,000 by the original owner of the car and still starts really well. It also has a block heater for the frigid winter days. The original markings are on the injection pump, which means that hasn't been tampered with.\nYour cool factor will increase by at least 69% when driving this vehicle. Don't think you'll stay cool though, because there is no air conditioner. The vent option is pretty lackluster as well, but you will roast on a good summer day and always be warm during the winter. The fan and heater core work perfectly - and if the fan isn't working just check the fuse. \nStop! There is no way this car can get any better. Well, stopping in general has never been a specialty of this vehicle, but it's even more of a crapshoot now that either the master cylinder has stopped working or there is a leak/kink in the brake lines. The parking brake works fantastically though and there are new brake pistons on the rear brakes. This is a fix that would take literally an afternoon.\nJust think, this piece of classic Pennsylvania craftsmanship for a low low price. Speaking of low, this vehicle has already been lowered on raceland coilovers, saving you time, money, and hassle! Other \"modifications\" include a replaced fuel tank, clutch replaced in April 2014 (maybe 3000 miles on it), rust holes patched, partially new interior - the rest is there for you to put in (still have the old stuff as well), a sweet custom dash, a new rear tire, replaced alternator, new glow plugs (February 2014), new in box timing belt, and probably some other stuff.\nSeriously, this car is a blast to drive and actually do hate to list it. But I don't have the time and room to work on it any more. I hope someone will restore it to the glory it deserves...which isn't a lot.",
